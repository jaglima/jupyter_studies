# Data Science Portfolio

This repository contains my portfolio of Data Science projects. This studies comes from hobby purposes, academic research and side-projects. It has been presented in the form of iPython Notebooks. All dataset available cames from open sources and are for demonstration purposes only. 
	Tools: Pandas, Matplotlib, Scipy, Numpy

Warning: Financial studies are not recommendation or financial advice in any circunstance.
